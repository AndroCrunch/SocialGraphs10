# Evolution of Crime Incidence Over Time

The time series of Drug/Narcotic and Assault crimes was analyzed for the following three time intervals/categories: 

* Crime rate per **year**
* Crime rate per **day of week**
* Crime rate per **hour**  

The interactive plot allows the user to observe the barchart for all three time intervals, and to select which crime type will be observed in the barchart. Additionally, the crime count values have been normalised, for easier comparison of the two crime types.

## Crime rate per year

From the yearly plot, it can be observed that the Drug/Narcotic crime is growing each year until 2009, followed by a significant decrease. Assault crime has become more constant over the years. Therefore, from the yearly plot, it can be concluded that there is no correlation between Drug/Narcotic and Assault crimes. 

## Crime rate per day of week

In the weekly plot, it can be observed that the Drug/Narcotic crime has the highest rate on Wednesday, while the crime rate of the Assault is higher on the weekend. Such an outcome is understandable, as the addiction-related crimes will be more evenly spread throughout the week, unlike the assault crimes which occur outside of people's working days. 


## Crime rate per hour

The hourly plot shows a higher similarity in crime rate between the two crime types, mostly due to the natural habits of people. However, in the night hours, there is a higher crime rate of Assault, as the attackers are less likely to be spotted while committing the crime.
