# Introduction

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.


# Evolution of Crime Incidence Over Time

The time series of Drug/Narcotic and Assault crimes was analyzed for the following three time intervals/categories: 

* Crime rate per **year**
* Crime rate per **day of week**
* Crime rate per **hour**  

The interactive plot allows the user to observe the barchart for all three time intervals, and to select which crime type will be observed in the barchart. Additionally, the crime count values have been normalised, for easier comparison  of the two crime types.
