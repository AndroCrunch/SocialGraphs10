# Introduction


# Basic stats and data analysis


# 5.1 Current Sales/Trends with Electric Vehicles Worldwide

To understand the problem thoroughly, the **spatial element** is very important. Our analysis shows that there is no clear correlation between drug crimes and assaults, and assaults are relatively equally spread across the city hence our **focus on drug arrests**. After data normalization, we color the districts with the highest degree of drug-related arrests in a **strong red color**, and the ones with lower amounts in **white** with the data spreading from **2003 to 2017**.

In general, there is a clear trend of **reduction of drug-related crimes** in the city except for the period during the **financial crisis of 2008**. Northern-eastern districts of the city have larger rates, and these are **Tenderloin, Northern, and Mission**. The main reason behind this is that this area is the city center and thus has a larger population proportion and flow. Specifically, **Tenderloin** in the district with the largest amount of Drug/Narcotic related crimes with **4,822 reported related arrests in 2008**.
Interestingly, when comparing SFPD data with personal income data, in assaults there is a similar number increase in all districts, while drug related crimes are moslty in lower-income parts. When dwelling into the history of Tenderloin, the district with the **highest proportion of drug-related crimes**, we find clear social and economic factors: many entertainment venues, high prostitution levels, and a big concentration of services for the homeless and people with substance abuse problems. However, when exploring additional factors such as social policies, urban development, and community data, we find that our conclusion lacks the bigger picture. Hence, we recommend using a wider approach in analyzing the phenomena especially due to the current opioid crisis.

When applying linear regression model, the data clearly shows that two types of crimes aren't related to each other. Instead, they seemed to be going in their own directions. On average, drug-related crimes were decreasing by about **500 incidents every year**, while assault cases were going up by about **333 incidents each year**. This shows how complicated these crime trends can be, and that there might be different reasons that impact each type of crime.
